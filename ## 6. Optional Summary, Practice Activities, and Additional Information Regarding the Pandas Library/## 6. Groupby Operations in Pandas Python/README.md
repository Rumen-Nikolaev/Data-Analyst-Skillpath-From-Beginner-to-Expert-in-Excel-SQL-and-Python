# Group By Operation in Pandas

Group by is a powerful functionality in the Pandas library that allows for grouping data in a DataFrame. This operation involves the combination of splitting objects, applying a function, and then combining the results. It's very similar to the group by functionality found in SQL and other query-based programs.
