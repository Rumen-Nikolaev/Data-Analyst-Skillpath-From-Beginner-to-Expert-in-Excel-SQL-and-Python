# MultiIndex in Pandas

## Overview
MultiIndex, also known as hierarchical indexing, is an advanced indexing technique used for working with higher dimensional data in Pandas. It allows for more complex and customizable indexing structures, which are particularly useful when dealing with large datasets. MultiIndex enables the storage and modification of data in smaller, more efficient structures like series and data frames.

## What is MultiIndex?
A MultiIndex is essentially a hierarchical representation of multiple levels of indices. It is commonly used to organize data that has a large number of indices grouped based on certain criteria. A MultiIndex object can be thought of as an array of unique tuples where each tuple represents a different level of the index.
