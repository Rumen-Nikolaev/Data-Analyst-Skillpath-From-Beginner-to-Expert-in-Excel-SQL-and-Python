# Python Data Types: Operations and Methods

## Overview

This document introduces common operations and methods for different Python data types, such as strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. By using indexing, slicing, and built-in methods, we can efficiently manipulate these data types.

## Variables and Indexing

We will start by initializing a set variable:

```python
set_1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
