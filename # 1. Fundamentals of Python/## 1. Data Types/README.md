# Python Basics

In this guide, we will cover the fundamental concepts of Python, including variables, data types, and basic operations.

## Variables in Python

A **variable** is a reserved memory location used to store values. When you create a variable, you reserve some space in memory for it. Variables allow you to store and manipulate data temporarily.

- Variables are created when you assign a value to them.
- Python variables do not require an explicit declaration.
- The data type of a variable is determined automatically by the interpreter based on the assigned value.

### Example of Variable Creation
```python
a = 10
name = "John"
miles = 130.7
city_name = "London"
