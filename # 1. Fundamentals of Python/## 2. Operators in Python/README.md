# Operators in Python

Operators are constructs that allow us to manipulate the value of operations. 

## What are operators?

In programming, operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. For example, in the expression `4 + 5`, `4` and `5` are operands, and `+` is the operator.

### Types of Operators in Python

Python supports several types of operators:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Logical Operators

These are the most commonly used operators in Python. Let's examine them one by one.

## 1. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are basic math operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.

For example, if we define two variables:

```python
A = 9
B = 15
