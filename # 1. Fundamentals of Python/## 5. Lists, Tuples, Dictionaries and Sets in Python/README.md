# Python Data Types: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets

## Overview
This document introduces essential Python data types, their creation, and basic functionalities. Understanding these data types is crucial for effective programming in Python.

## Sequences in Python
A sequence is a data structure that holds a collection of elements, each assigned a unique index starting from 0. Python has six built-in sequence types, with the most common being:

- **Strings**
- **Lists**
- **Tuples**

Operations like indexing, slicing, adding, multiplying, and checking membership are common across all sequence types. Python also provides functions for finding the length of a sequence and identifying the largest and smallest elements.

## Lists
A list is a versatile and mutable data type in Python, which can store elements of different types. Lists are created by enclosing a comma-separated series of values within square brackets `[]`.

### Example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", 15.5]
