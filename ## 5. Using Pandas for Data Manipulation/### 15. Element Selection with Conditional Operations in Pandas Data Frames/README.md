# DataFrame Element Selection with Conditional Operations

## Overview
This guide explains how to perform element selection in a DataFrame structure using conditional operations in Python.

## Selecting Elements Based on Conditions

1. **Basic Condition**
   - To select elements greater than a specified value (e.g., 20):
     ```python
     df[df > 20]
     ```

2. **NaN Values**
   - When the condition is not met, the output will be `NaN`:
     ```python
     df[df > 20]
     ```

3. **Selecting Specific Columns**
   - To select elements in a specific column (e.g., `Val1`) that are less than 20:
     ```python
     df['Val1'][df['Val1'] < 20]
     ```

4. **Displaying as DataFrame**
   - To view the result as a DataFrame:
     ```python
     df[df['Val1'] < 20][['Val2']]
     ```

5. **Selecting Multiple Columns**
   - To select multiple columns (e.g., `Val2` and `Val5`):
     ```python
     df[df['Val1'] < 20][['Val2', 'Val5']]
     ```

## Combining Conditions

1. **Using the AND Operator**
   - To select values where `Val1` is greater than 20 and `Val4` is less than 18:
     ```python
     df[(df['Val1'] > 20) & (df['Val4'] < 18)]
     ```

2. **Using the OR Operator**
   - To select values that are less than 35 or greater than 20 in `Val5`:
     ```python
     df[(df < 35) | (df['Val5'] > 20)]
     ```

## Using the .loc Method
- To select values greater than 25 in `Val2` and return corresponding columns `Val3` and `Val5`:
  ```python
  df.loc[df['Val2'] > 25, ['Val2', 'Val3', 'Val5']]
