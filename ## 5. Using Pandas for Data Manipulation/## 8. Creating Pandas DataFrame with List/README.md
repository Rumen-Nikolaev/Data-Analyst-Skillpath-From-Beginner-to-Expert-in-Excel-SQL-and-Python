# Introduction to Pandas DataFrames

## What is a Pandas DataFrame?

A Pandas DataFrame is a multidimensional data structure that resembles SQL or Excel tables, consisting of rows and columns. DataFrames are particularly useful in data analysis due to their structured format, allowing for easy manipulation and analysis of data.

## Why Use DataFrames?

While the NumPy library is excellent for scientific calculations, it forces values in arrays to a fixed type. This limitation makes it challenging to handle mixed types of data (categorical and continuous values). DataFrames in Pandas provide a flexible way to manage such data without these restrictions.
