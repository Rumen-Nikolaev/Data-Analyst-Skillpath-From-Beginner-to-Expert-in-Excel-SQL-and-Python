# Grouping and Aggregation Operations in Pandas

This project demonstrates how to perform **grouping** and **aggregation** operations using the Pandas library in Python. We explore common grouping functions such as `value_counts`, `groupby`, `mean`, and how to handle missing values (`NaN` values).

## Introduction
In this project, we will explore how to group data and apply aggregation functions on grouped data in Pandas. This includes:
- Grouping data by specific columns
- Applying aggregation functions like `mean`, `sum`, `unique`
- Handling missing values and `NaN` values

We use a dataset of **planets** and their discovery methods as an example.
