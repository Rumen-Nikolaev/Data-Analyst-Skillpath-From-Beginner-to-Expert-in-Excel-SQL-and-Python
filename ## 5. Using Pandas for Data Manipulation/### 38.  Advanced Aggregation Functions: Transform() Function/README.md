# DataFrame Transformations with Pandas

This guide demonstrates how to apply transformations to numerical columns in a pandas DataFrame using the `transform` function. We will cover normalization of values and applying a custom transformation (e.g., taking the sine of values). Additionally, we compare the differences between the `transform` and `filter` functions.
