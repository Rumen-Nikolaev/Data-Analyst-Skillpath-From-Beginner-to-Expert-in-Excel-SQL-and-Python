# Reading and Writing Data in R

This document outlines how to read and write data in R from various file formats, including CSV and Excel.

## Working Directory

Before reading or writing files, ensure that the file is present in the current working directory. You can check the current working directory using:

```r
getwd()
```

To set a new working directory, use:

```r
setwd("path/to/your/directory")
```

## Reading Excel Files

R can read Excel files using the `readxl` package. If you don't have this package installed, you can install it using:

```r
install.packages("readxl")
```

### Create an Excel File

To create an Excel file, open Microsoft Excel, create columns A and B, and fill the cells with some numbers. Save this file in your working directory.

### Reading the Excel File

To read the Excel file in R, use the following code:

```r
library(readxl)

# Reading the Excel file
data <- read_excel("filename.xlsx")
view(data)  # Display the data in a viewer
```

## Reading CSV Files

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are a common format for storing tabular data. You can read CSV files using R's built-in functions.

### Create a CSV File

You can create a CSV file in Excel by saving it as a `.csv` file.

### Reading the CSV File

To read a CSV file in R, use the `read.csv()` function:

```r
# Reading the CSV file
csv_data <- read.csv("test_data.csv", sep = ",")
```

If your CSV file uses semicolons instead of commas, specify the separator:

```r
# Reading a CSV file with semicolon separator
csv_data <- read.csv("test_data.csv", sep = ";")
```

## Getting Help

If you need help with a specific function, use the question mark (`?`) before the function name:

```r
?read.csv
```

## Importing Data from the Web

R can also read data from the web using `read.csv()` if the file is accessible via HTTP:

```r
web_data <- read.csv("http://example.com/data.csv")
```

## Data Frame Operations

After reading data into a data frame, you can apply various functions to manipulate it:

```r
# Check the number of rows and columns
nrow(csv_data)  # Number of rows
ncol(csv_data)  # Number of columns
```

## Importing Data from Other Sources

R provides options to import data from various sources, including:

- Text files
- SPSS files
- Excel files
- Online and offline databases

When importing data, you can specify whether the first row contains headers, helping R identify variable names.
