# Working with Arrays in R

## Overview

An array is essentially a multidimensional vector in R. The components must all be of the same type. Individual elements inside an array are accessed using square brackets.

A vector has only one dimension, while an array with two dimensions is called a matrix. Anything with more than two dimensions is simply referred to as an array.

A vector can be used as an array if it has a dimension vector as its `dim` attribute.
