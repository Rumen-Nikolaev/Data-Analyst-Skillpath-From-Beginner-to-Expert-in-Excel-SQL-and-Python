# NumPy Array Creation with the `eye` Function

The `eye` function in NumPy is used to create a unit matrix, also known as an identity matrix, where the main diagonal is filled with ones and all other elements are zeros.

## Overview

The `eye` function generates a two-dimensional array based on the number of rows and columns specified.

### Syntax

```python
numpy.eye(N, M=None, k=0, dtype=<class 'float'>)
