# Reshaping NumPy Arrays

In this guide, we will examine the process of reshaping NumPy arrays using the `reshape` function.

## Why Reshape an Array?

When we create an array, it may initially be one-dimensional. However, in many cases, we need to work with a two-dimensional array instead. The `reshape` function allows us to convert a one-dimensional array into a two-dimensional one.
