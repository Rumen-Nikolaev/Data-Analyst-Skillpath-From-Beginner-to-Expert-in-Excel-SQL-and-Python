# Slicing Two-Dimensional NumPy Arrays

In this guide, we'll explore how to slice two-dimensional arrays in NumPy. We will generate a two-dimensional array and perform slicing operations to extract specific rows, columns, and sections of the array.

## Importing NumPy and Creating a 2D Array

First, let's import NumPy and create a 2D array with numbers up to 30.
