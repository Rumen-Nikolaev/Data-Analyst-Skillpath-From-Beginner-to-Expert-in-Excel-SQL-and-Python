# Introduction to NumPy Arrays

Welcome! In this lesson, we're going to create a NumPy array using the `array` function. 

## What is a NumPy Array?

A NumPy array is a data structure in the NumPy library. You can think of it as similar to a list, a dictionary, or even a tuple in Python. 

### Creating NumPy Arrays

You can create NumPy arrays using fundamental data structures in Python, such as lists, tables, or sets. 

### Importing NumPy

To work with NumPy, you first need to import it into your Python environment. You can do this by using the following command:

```python
import numpy as np
